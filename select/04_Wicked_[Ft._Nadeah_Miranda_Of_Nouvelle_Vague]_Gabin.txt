We're wicked (2)

Wicked

Come on
Free your mind
We're wicked (2)

They sent me walking all alone in the wood one day
They told me smile, you're little red riding hood, ok?
I'm sick of being a prey for hunters and wolves, you see
I pick no flowers, warnings don't mean a thing to me

Poor Cinderella got fed up now she's changed her mind
Done with the phoney prince, it's now her turn to be unkind
She won't call no fairy, she's a ragged lady
At parties she gets high, drinks gin in her crystal shoe

Wicked
That's so fine
Free all fairies
And Free your mind Male bv: (Oh little darling, you're my lovely doll)

We're wicked (4)

Check it out Check it out, who's rapping fast in the microphone?
The little mermaid with a necklace made out of fish bones
And sleeping beauty is getting ready for bed at noon
Goldilocks trying to do her hair all pitch black quite soon
Two poisoned apples tied up tight in her wonder bra
Snowhite has seven little boyfriends at the same time
Goody-goody sisters, say goodbye to blisters
Stand up and shout out loud I'm done with that old tale of mine

Wicked
That's so fine
Free all fairies
Come on
Free your mind Male bv: (Oh little darling, you're my lovely doll)
We're wicked (4)

(I do it for you love...)

Wicked
That's so fine
Free all fairies
Free your mind
We're wicked (4 and more.to the end)

(Oh little darling, you're my lovely doll)
